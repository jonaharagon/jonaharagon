### Hi, Iâ€™m Jonah ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an IT professional, system administrator, and data privacy advocate currently working with [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org) and Techlore.

I am deprecating GitHub for my own personal use, projects of mine should be available at [sr.ht/~jonaharagon](https://sr.ht/~jonaharagon/) in the future, but I'll continue using this account to contribute to other projects.

As of April 28, 2022 I sign all my Git commits with SSH. GitHub will now show these commits as verified, but my SSH key fingerprint is `SHA256:oJSBSFgpWl4g+IwjL96Ya8ocGfI7r6VKnQw+257pZZ0` if you'd like to check yourself.

Contact information and other accounts I use online are all [listed on my website](https://www.jonaharagon.com/accounts), please check there for further information.
