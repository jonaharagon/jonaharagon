### Hi, Iâ€™m Jonah ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an IT professional, system administrator, and data privacy advocate. I create educational resources for average people to understand the importance of privacy and security on the internet, and take back control over their digital lives.

You may know me from work on the [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CZRb5Z4qZjsIGZrUWbDc3Mn) YouTube channel, including the [Techlore Talks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27252550/) podcast I co-host, and the [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org) non-profit website which I founded and am a lead contributor to.

As of April 28, 2022 I sign all my Git commits with SSH. GitHub will now show these commits as verified, but my SSH key fingerprint is `SHA256:oJSBSFgpWl4g+IwjL96Ya8ocGfI7r6VKnQw+257pZZ0` if you'd like to check yourself.

Contact information and other accounts I use online are all [listed on my website](https://www.jonaharagon.com/accounts), please check there for further information.
